## Course Overview

Welcome to the second course in the [Educational Data Science Specialization](https://education.uoregon.edu/data-science-specialization-educational-leadership) taught at the University of Oregon through the College of Education. This course will be taught through [R](https://cran.r-project.org), a free and open-source statistical computing environment, and will provide students with the foundational principles and practice of data visualization, particularly as applied to scientific and technical data. We will have weekly lectures, covering a wide variety of topics including human perception, color theory, and principles of visual design. We will also cover mediums for communication across diverse audiences with an emphasis on web deployment. Hands-on laboratory sessions provide students the opportunity to put the lecture material into practice.

### Course Goals

The course has three main goals: 

-   To provide graduate students with foundational principles and practice of data visualizations.
-   To familiarize students with best practice and inclusive design principles for effective education science communication through data visualization for policy and praxis 
-   To introduce and inspire students to believe in the power of data and design to reveal insights about core education issues—including inequality, uncertainty, and variation in educational opportunities across the Pre-K-16 education system.


### Student Learning objectives

By the end of this course, students should be able to:

-   Transform data in a variety of ways to create effective data visualizations
-   Understand best practices in data visualization, including inclusive design
-   Create and customize graphics in a variety of ways using best practices (e.g., visual perception, color choices, text annotations, categorical axis ordering, uncertainty)
-   Build web-based platforms for sharing data visualizations

## Course Readings

All course readings are freely available online or will be provided by the
instructor. We will have chapters from each of the following books:

{{< course-books >}}

Each of the above links to the full book. These are excellent resources that I highly suggest you dive into, particularly if you find yourself having difficulty with a particular topic. The “other” listed above will include additional readings for topics not covered by the books (e.g., [Matthew Kay’s](https://twitter.com/mjskay) excellent [keynote presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1kSnWvqCw0&feature=youtu.be) on uncertainty visualization at the 2018 Tapestry conference). See the [schedule](../schedule) page for details on specific readings.

## Assignments and Grading

There are 200 points possible. Your final grade will be composed of four components:

-   Class Participation (60 points; 30%)
    -   Labs In-Class (40 points; 20%)
    -   Discussion   (20 points; 10%)
-   3 lab problem sets at 20 points each (60 points; 30%)
-   1 Data Viz in the Wild (10 points; 5%)
-   Final Project (70 points; 35%)
    -   Proposal (20 points; 10%)
    -   Presentation (20 points; 10%)
    -   Output (30 points; 15%)

I would like to, as much a possible, stick to the deadlines for all assignments as listed in the [schedule](../schedule) page. This will allow us to go over the material together as a group *after* everyone has submitted their assignment. However, **if you need additional time for any reason** please just send me a note letting me know. You do not need to justify why. I am more than happy to work with you however I can. I would just ask that you please **not** attend class during the time we are going over the assignment (but please do attend the rest of the class if you are able).

### Class Participation (60 points; 30%)

Your class participation grade comes exclusively from your active participation in the class through discussions and hands-on lab sessions. Active participation requires you to do the readings prior to coming to class so that you can keep up with the lecture portion of the class and work on the hands-on lab activities. Completing readings prior to class will (1) greatly improve your ability to understand what we discuss in class; and (2) it will enable you to complete the in-class, lab activities and participate in discussions, which will benefit you and your classmates. As you can see, these form a significant portion (30%) of your final grade as well. 

Every week there will be in-class labs. They will be assigned in class (through the website). Labs will include designated in-class time every week, but any work not completed during class must be completed on your own. Labs will be scored on a “best honest effort” basis, which generally implies zero or full credit. Many of the labs require completion of specific portions before moving on to the next sections. If you find yourself stuck and unable to proceed, **please contact the instructor for help rather than submitting incomplete work.** Contacting the instructor is part of the “best honest effort.” If the assignment is not complete, and the student has not contacted the instructor for help and obtained approval for submitting incomplete work, only partial credit will be awarded. Partially completed problem sets that have been discussed with the instructor may receive partial credit. Assignments will be posted as .Rmd files. Each student must turn in the completed lab work electronically on Canvas as a Word or Pdf file (after knitting your .Rmd file) with your last name as the beginning of the file name. If you are hosting your work online as a GitHub repo, you can also post the link to the GitHub repo.

Generally, you can choose to work on any and all labs individually or in small groups. However, given that the final is a group project, I highly encourage you to find a small group (no more than 3) and work on all labs and the final together.


### Lab Problem Sets (60 points; 30%)

There are three lab problem sets, which are essentially an extended labs, with two exceptions:

-   No time will be designated during class for the lab problem set completion necessarily
-   They will be scored on a correct/incorrect basis (not on effort).

These are due Monday of the week it’s listed on the syllabus.

Similar to the in-class labs, you can choose to work on the lab problem sets individually or as a small group. If you choose to work in a small group, you **must** work through a shared GitHub repo and all members of the group should have commits in the repo.

Together, the lab problem sets form 30% of your final grade.

### Data visualizations “in the wild” presentation (10 points; 5%)

On the first day of the class you will be randomly assigned a date to share two data visualizations you have found in publications or websites or anywhere else IRL (in real life). This is not a formal presentation. You share the links to the data visualizations with me, and I will project them. You will then discuss where you found each visual and what you like/dislike about it. We will then have a brief discussion as a class for each of the two visuals.

Note that this project is aimed at identifying a range of data visualizations.
It would be ideal if both model data visualizations and poor data visualizations
were presented from a variety of sources.

### Final Project (70 points; 35%)

Please see the [assignments](../assignments/) page for full details on the final project, which will include a portfolio of your data visualizations using the [course data](../2021-12-10-accessing-the-data/). At least **four** different data visualizations must be included, as well as the history of how the visualization changed over time (initial draft to final product). The portfolios must be housed on *GitHub* and be reproducible. It can be helpful to make final modifications to your plot through systems outside of R (e.g., Adobe Illustrator, Inkscape). If you choose to make these modifications (not required) they are the one (and only) acceptable exception to full reproducibility.

The due date for the proposal can be (somewhat) flexible. However, unlike the labs and homework, the remaining aspects of the final project cannot be changed and you will lose points if your work is submitted late without prior approval. This is mostly because of concerns related peer-review and completing the project by the end of the term.

The components of the final project are as follow:

-   Proposal (20 points; 10%)
-   Presentation (20 points; 10%)
-   Product (30 points; 15%)

The final project must be completed in a small group of 2-3 students. You will work together from a common dataset to create these visuals.


### Extra Credit

There is one opportunity for extra credit, which is worth up to 10
points. This includes an in-depth self-study of a topic not explicitly covered in the class. Students opting into the extra credit option will provide a 5-10 minute presentation on their chosen topic to the class. For example, interactive and animated graphics are not explicitly covered, but packages like [gganimate](https://gganimate.com/index.html) are powerful and fun. Network visualizations is another examples of a topic that will not be covered but is nonetheless important. You could choose one of these areas, explore a different topic, or provide greater detail on a topic that *is* covered in class (e.g., geographic data).

If you are interested in giving a brief talk on a topic of your choice, please contact me as soon as possible to obtain approval on the topic and set a date for the presentation.

## Campus Emergency

In the event of a campus emergency that disrupts academic activities, course requirements, deadlines, and grading percentages are subject to change. Information about changes in this course will be communicated as soon as possible by email, and on Canvas. If we are not able to meet face-to-face, students should immediately log onto Canvas and read any announcements and/or access alternative assignments. Students are also encouraged to continue the readings and other assignments as outlined on this syllabus or subsequent syllabi.

## Fluidity, Attendance, Participation

I encourage you to talk with me about what you are experiencing so we can work together to help you succeed in this course.

## Expected Engagement

**Participate and Contribute:** Students are expected to participate by sharing ideas and contributing to the collective learning environment. This entails preparing, following instructions, and engaging respectfully and thoughtfully with others. More specific participation guidelines and criteria for contributions will be provided for each specific activity.

**Please use good “online etiquette”:** Identify yourself with your real name and use a subject line that clearly relates to your contribution. Write or speak in the first person when sharing your opinions and ideas but when addressing other students or discussing their ideas, use their names. Respect the privacy of your classmates and what they share in class. Understand that we may disagree and that exposure to other people’s opinions is part of the learning experience. Good online etiquette also means using humor or sarcasm carefully, remembering that non-verbal cues (such as facial expressions) are not always possible or clear in a remote context. In addition, your language should be free of profanity, appropriate for an academic context, and exhibit interest in and courtesy for others’ contributions. Be aware that typing in all capital letters indicates shouting. Certain breaches of online etiquette can be considered disruptive behavior.

**Expect and Respect Diversity:** All classes at the University of Oregon welcome and respect diverse experiences, perspectives, and approaches. What is not welcome are behaviors or contributions that undermine, demean, or marginalize others based on race, ethnicity, gender, sex, age, sexual orientation, religion, ability, or socioeconomic status. We will value differences and communicate disagreements with respect.

**Help Everyone Learn:** Our goal is to learn together by learning from one another. As we move forward learning during this challenging time, it is important that we work together and build on our strengths. Not everyone is savvy in remote learning, including your instructor, and this means we need to be patient with each other, identify ways we can assist others, and be open-minded to receiving help and advice from others. No one should hesitate to contact me to ask for assistance or offer suggestions that might help us learn better.

**Specific guidelines for best practices using Canvas Discussion:**

1.  Use subject lines that clearly communicate the content of your post
2.  Write clearly and concisely and be aware that humor or sarcasm often doesn’t always translate in an online environment.
3.  Be supportive and considerate when replying to others’ posts. This means avoiding use of jargon or inappropriate language, and it means disagreeing with respect and providing clear rationale or evidence to support your different view.
4.  Try to use correct spelling and grammar and proofread your submissions. After submitting, use the edit feature to make corrections and resubmit (don’t create a new or duplicate post that corrects your error).
5.  Contribute and interact often!

**Specific guidelines for best practices if and when we use Zoom:**

1.  Please test your video and audio prior to joining a live class session. You can learn more about testing your audio and video by visiting the UO Service Portal.
2.  Try to be on time when the class starts. It can be distracting to have participants join late.
3.  Use a microphone or speak closely to your computer microphone so that others can hear you.  
4.  Mute your audio when you are not actively contributing. When contributing, avoid making other noises such as typing or having side conversations with others that might be present with you.
5.  Use chat to pose questions or offer insights “on the side” while others are contributing. The chat can be read by all and should reflect a high standard of respect for our class community.
6.  For help and troubleshooting with Zoom, visit the UO Service Portal.

## Course Policies

### Attendance and Absence Guidelines

This is a face-to-face course. Attendance is important because we will develop our knowledge through in-class activities that require your active engagement. We’ll have discussions, small-group activities, and do other work during class that will be richer for your presence, and that you won’t be able to benefit from if you are not there. Excessive absences make it impossible to learn well and succeed in the course. If you miss 2 or more classes, your grades will be affected significantly (class participation points will be deducted for missed classes unless you communicate with me in advance and complete alternative tasks). While this course follows a reason-neutral attendance policy (you do not have to give me any reason for missing classes and I will not distinguish between excused and unexcused absences!), if you must miss a class email me and we can figure out alternative lab assignments.

### Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
It is the policy of the University of Oregon to support and value equity and diversity and to provide inclusive learning environments for all students.  To do so requires that we: 
- respect the dignity and essential worth of all individuals. 
- promote a culture of respect throughout the University community. 
- respect the privacy, property, and freedom of others. 
- reject bigotry, discrimination, violence, or intimidation of any kind. 
- practice personal and academic integrity and expect it from others. 
- promote the diversity of opinions, ideas and backgrounds which is the lifeblood of the university.

In this course, class discussions, projects/activities and assignments will challenge students to think critically about and be sensitive to the influence, and intersections, of race, ethnicity, nationality, documentation, language, religion, gender, socioeconomic background, physical and cognitive ability, sexual orientation, and other cultural identities and experiences. Students will be encouraged to develop or expand their respect and understanding of such differences.

Maintaining an inclusive classroom environment where all students feel able to talk about their cultural identities and experiences, ideas, beliefs, and values will not only be my responsibility, but the responsibility of each class member as well. Behavior that disregards or diminishes another student will not be permitted for any reason. This means that no racist, ableist, transphobic, xenophobic, chauvinistic, or otherwise derogatory comments will be allowed. It also means that students must pay attention and listen respectfully to each other’s comments.

### Use of GenAI:
Learning to use artificial intelligence systems such as ChatGPT/Claude (and others we’ll discuss together) and recognize their pluses and minuses are important emerging skills. Their use will be allowed and encouraged for certain activities and tasks in this course (e.g., as a copilot for coding during lab activities and problem sets, and final project), which I’ll explicitly note along the way. I’ll also clearly indicate when such systems are not allowed or are discouraged. To support our collective learning about these systems, I will post resources about them in Canvas. I also welcome questions you may have about their use and am happy to meet and discuss how they might help or hinder your learning.


### Indigenous Recognition Statement

The University of Oregon is located on Kalapuya Ilihi, the traditional indigenous homeland of the Kalapuya people. Today, descendants are citizens of the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of Oregon and the Confederated Tribes of the Siletz Indians of Oregon, and they continue to make important contributions in their communities, at UO, and across the land we now refer to as Oregon.

### Using Pronouns and Personal Preference

The College of Education is always working to include and engage everyone. One way we can do this is to share your pronouns, or the words you want to be called when people aren’t using your name. Like names, pronouns are an important part of how we identify that deserves to be respected. And we recognize that assuming someone’s gender can be hurtful, especially to members of our community who are transgender, genderqueer, or non-binary. As a community, we are all learning together about the importance of pronouns and being better allies to the trans community on campus. Please discuss the pronouns you wish to be used with your professor to help them be aware of how to address you respectfully. Please visit this university website for more information.  
(https://studentlife.uoregon.edu/pronouns) 

Please let me know if aspects of the instruction, course design, or class activities undermine these principles in any way. You may also notify the (Home Department) at (contact information). For additional assistance and resources, you may also consider contacting the Division of Equity and Inclusion through their website or by phone (at 541-346-3175), or the Center for Multicultural Academic Excellence through their website or by phone (at 541-346-3479).

### Mental Health and Wellness 
Life at college can be very complicated. Students often feel overwhelmed or stressed, experience anxiety or depression, struggle with relationships, or just need help navigating challenges in their life. If you're facing such challenges, you don't need to handle them on your own--there's help and support on campus. 
As your instructor if I believe you may need additional support, I will express my concerns, the reasons for them, and refer you to resources that might be helpful. It is not my intention to know the details of what might be bothering you, but simply to let you know I care, and that help is available. Getting help is a courageous thing to do—for yourself and those you care about.

University Health Services help students cope with difficult emotions and life stressors. If you need general resources on coping with stress or want to talk with another student who has been in the same place as you, visit the Duck Nest (located in the EMU on the ground floor) and get help from one of the specially trained Peer Wellness Advocates. Find out more at health.uoregon.edu/ducknest. 

University Counseling Services (UCS) has a team of dedicated staff members to support you with your concerns, many of whom can provide identity-based support. All clinical services are free and confidential. Find out more at counseling.uoregon.edu or by calling 541-346-3227 (anytime UCS is closed, the After-Hours Support and Crisis Line is available by calling this same number).”

### Basic Needs

Any student who has difficulty affording groceries or accessing sufficient food to eat every day, or who lacks a safe and stable place to live and believes this may affect their performance in the course is urged to contact the Dean of Students Office (346-3216, 164 Oregon Hall) for support.

This UO [webpage] (https://blogs.uoregon.edu/basicneeds/food/) includes resources for food, housing, healthcare, childcare, transportation, technology, finances, and legal support.

### Children in class

I applaud all of you who go to graduate school with children! I understand the difficulty in balancing academic, work, and family commitments. I want you to succeed. Here are my policies regarding children in class:

1.  All breastfeeding babies are welcome in class as often as necessary.
2.  Non-nursing babies and older children are welcome whenever alternate arrangements cannot be made. As a parent of two young children, I understand that babysitters fall through, partners have conflicting schedules, children get sick, and other issues arise that leave parents with few other options.
3.  In cases where children come to class, I invite parents/caregivers to sit close to the door so as to more easily excuse yourself to attend to your child’s needs. Non-parents in the class: please reserve seats near the door for your parenting classmates.
4.  All students are expected to join with me in creating a welcoming environment that is respectful of your classmates who bring children to class.

I understand that sleep deprivation and exhaustion are among the most difficult aspects of parenting young children. The struggle of balancing school, work, childcare, and graduate school is tiring (not to mention being in the middle of a pandemic!), and I will do my best to accommodate any such issues while maintaining the same high expectations for all students enrolled in the class. ***Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions or concerns.***

### Accessible Education

The University of Oregon is working to create inclusive learning environments. Please notify me if there are aspects of the instruction or design of this course that result in disability-related barriers to your participation. Participation includes access to lectures, web-based information, in-class activities, and exams. The Accessible Education Center (http://aec.uoregon.edu/) works with students to provide an instructor notification letter that outlines accommodations and adjustments to class design that will enable better access. Contact the Accessible Education Center in 360 Oregon Hall at 541-346-1155 or uoaec@uoregon.edu for assistance with access or disability-related questions or concerns.

### Accommodation for Religious Observances
The university makes reasonable accommodations, upon request, for students who are unable to attend a class for religious obligations or observance reasons, in accordance with the university discrimination policy which says “Any student who, because of religious beliefs, is unable to attend classes on a particular day shall be excused from attendance requirements and from any examination or other assignment on that day. The student shall make up the examination or other assignment missed because of the absence.” To request accommodations for this course for religious observance, visit the Office of the Registrar's website (https://registrar.uoregon.edu/calendars/religious-observances) and complete and submit to the instructor the “Student Religious Accommodation Request” form prior to the end of the second week of the term.

### Academic Integrity

You can find faculty resources on academic misconduct here: https://dos.uoregon.edu/faculty-resources
The University Student Conduct Code (available at conduct.uoregon.edu) defines academic misconduct. Students are prohibited from committing or attempting to commit any act that constitutes academic misconduct. By way of example, students should not give or receive (or attempt to give or receive) unauthorized help on assignments or examinations without express permission from the instructor. Students should properly acknowledge and document all sources of information (e.g., quotations, paraphrases, ideas) and use only the sources and resources authorized by the instructor. If there is any question about whether an act constitutes academic misconduct, it is the students’ obligation to clarify the question with the instructor before committing or attempting to commit the act. Additional information about a common form of academic misconduct, plagiarism, is available at https://researchguides.uoregon.edu/citing-plagiarism.”

Students are also encouraged to continue the readings and other assignments as outlined in this syllabus or subsequent syllabi.

### Inclement Weather

If it becomes necessary to cancel class while the University remains open, this will be announced on Canvas and by email. Updates on inclement weather and closure are also communicated in other ways described here: https://hr.uoregon.edu/about-hr/campus-notifications/inclement-weather/inclement-weather-immediate-updates”

Due to unsafe travel conditions, departmental staff may be limited and unable to handle the volume of calls from you and others.

### Course Incomplete Policy

Students are expected to be familiar with university policy regarding grades of “incomplete” and the time line for completion. For details on the policy and procedures regarding incompletes, Please see: https://education.uoregon.edu/academics/incompletes-courses

### Other Accomodations

My goal is to support you in doing the best work you can considering the challenges you face. I understand that college students face tremendous pressure to work hard, get “good” grades, and be as “successful” as possible. That said, I encourage you to remember that your health and well-being are far more important than the work you do in this class or any class. And I encourage you to take the time you need to care for yourself and for your loved ones. If you are finding it difficult to balance your health and well-being with your work in this class, please let me know. It is okay to ask for help and to acknowledge when you are struggling, and I am happy to help connect you with resources and services on campus and also make accommodations to our course plan as needed. 
I also ask that you be patient with me if the challenges of this term (it’s my second term here at the UO and first time teaching this class!) force me to make last-minute changes to the course plan. I will do my best to communicate any changes clearly and make them with respect for the inconvenience, frustration, and confusion that change may cause.
