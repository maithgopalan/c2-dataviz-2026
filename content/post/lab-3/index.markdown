## Overview

* The purpose of this lab is to get you to replicate Saloni's charts from [here](https://github.com/saloni-nd/scientific-discovery).

## Data 

You have two replication suggestions from Saloni

* Birth seasonality chart from this [blogpost](https://www.scientificdiscovery.dev/p/20-so-many-great-things-you-missed)
* Mortality rates across the lifespan from this [blogpost](https://www.scientificdiscovery.dev/p/11-everything-great-ive-read-in-the). Its the the blue-purple-red line chart.


## Tasks

* 1. Replicate as is (Fork repo and replicate - No pull requests)

* 2. Bonus points: Create a (free) account on the Human Mortality Database to update the data to beyond 2019, for any one new country not included in the second chart.

## Finishing up 
When you have finished the above, upload your rendered (knit) HTML/pdf file to canvas.
